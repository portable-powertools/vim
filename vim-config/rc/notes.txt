Goals:
   - session-persistent variables have to be checked for being already set in vimrc
   - working directory: find good way to do it. 
              make rooter command easy to use
              everything manual
              no persistent state whatsoever except 'bare' sessions
              use prosession? and just cd to everything
   - plugin behavior session specific:
      - todo.txt is just textfile editing and not vims problem
      - bookmarks - leave global for now look into it later
