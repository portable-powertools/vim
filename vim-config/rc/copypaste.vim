" candidates for changing:
" g:EasyClipCopyExplicitRegisterToDefault -  Everytthing is copied also to the default clipboard by default. 
" g:EasyClipPreserveCursorPositionAfterYank - Default 0 (ie. disabled). Vim's default behaviour is to position the cursor at the beginning of the yanked text, which is consistent with other motions. However if you prefer the cursor position to remain unchanged when performing yanks, enable this option.
